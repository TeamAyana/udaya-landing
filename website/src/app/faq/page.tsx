    title: 'Medical & Safety',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Is cannabis legal at your retreats?',
        answer: 'Yes—for medical use with a prescription under Thailand\'s rules. Recreational sale and advertising are restricted; public use is limited. We comply fully.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do I need my own prescription?',
        answer: 'We review any existing prescription and coordinate with Thai-licensed practitioners. Some guests are evaluated on site.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What if I have a medical emergency?',
        answer: 'We maintain 24/7 medical staff on-site. We\'re partnered with Hua Hin Hospital (10 minutes) and Bangkok Hospital Hua Hin for any advanced interventions.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I attend during chemotherapy or radiation?',
        answer: 'Often, yes—with a letter from your lead clinician and approval from our medical team. We adapt dosing and activities to your energy.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Cannabis Medicine',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'What if I\'ve never used cannabis?',
        answer: 'Perfect. We specialize in cannabis-naive patients. We start with micro-doses, educate thoroughly, and increase gradually under medical supervision.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What types of cannabis medicine?',
        answer: 'Primarily Rick Simpson Oil (RSO/FECO) for full-spectrum benefits, high-CBD formulations, CBG for inflammation. All administered as oils, capsules, or tinctures—no smoking required.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What if I prefer a non-THC path?',
        answer: 'We can design CBD-forward or non-cannabinoid pathways where appropriate and lawful. (THC is what treats cancer)'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Program Specifics',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Why is the first retreat cancer-specific?',
        answer: 'We\'ve chosen to focus our inaugural program on cancer patients to provide specialized support. Future retreats will expand to other conditions.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Why 10 days?',
        answer: 'Our research shows 10 days provides optimal benefit for cancer patients—long enough for cannabis optimization, short enough to fit between treatments. Extensions available.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How big are cohorts?',
        answer: 'Small. Maximum 12 participants. Enough for community, few enough for real attention.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can my caregiver join?',
        answer: 'Yes—as a participant or day partner. Dedicated caregiver content is included.'
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    title: 'Practical Matters',
    questions: [
      {
        question: 'Travel to Hua Hin?',
        answer: 'Private transfer from Bangkok typically takes 2.5–4 hours for ~200 km. We arrange vetted options.'
      },
      {
        question: 'When exactly in Q2 2026?',
        answer: 'Target windows: late April, May, early June. Dates release to waitlist first.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What about dietary restrictions?',
        answer: 'Our kitchen accommodates all medical diets, allergies, and preferences.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is this religious?',
        answer: 'No. While we draw from Buddhist mindfulness traditions, the program is entirely secular.'
      }
